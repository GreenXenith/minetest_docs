:description: A sample template for using AsciiDoc.
:keywords: sample

This is a sample template of how a good AsciiDoc can be structured.
This pragraph describes the purpose of the document.
In this sample, an imaginary API
for producing pomegranates will be documented.

So without further ado, here is what we should see when we are done.
